# Example Application

## First Version

Here's my idea of what the first version of the example application should do, sans the methods to achieve it.

Basically, it should have a function that says something along the lines of "Hello, []!", which calls a 'random name' function from one of Sage's libraries/subsystems.

Therefore the output would look something like:
    - Hello, Sage!
    - Hello, Mint!
    - Hello, World!

The purpose of this is so that we are able to demonstrate the following; hot loading of the example application to change the 'hello' to something like 'goodbye' in realtime, hot loading of the sage library to change and add names to the list of names to say hello to.
